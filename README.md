### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer engineering student at Metropolitan University with a strong passion for IT and coding. I'm eager to learn and grow in the world of technology. Here's a bit more about me:

- ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm focused on my coursework, and I'm excited to dive into coding projects soon.

- ðŸ‘¯ I'm open to collaborating on coding projects, especially with fellow students who are on a similar learning journey.
- ðŸ¤” As a beginner, I know my code might sometimes resemble spaghetti, so any guidance or feedback is greatly appreciated.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about my experiences as a beginner coder or any questions you may have about IT and computer engineering.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via email at [your_email@example.com].
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm fascinated by the potential of technology to simplify tasks and enhance our daily lives.
